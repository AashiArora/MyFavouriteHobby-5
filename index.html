        <p>My favourite hobby is playing with dogs I love to play with dogs because they are affectionate and loving. I always love to play with dogs. I am ready to play with them at anytime whenever i am free. It's truely said that dogs our humans best friend. They are very loving but you need to take care of them nicely don't leave your dog alone for long time. Spend time with them. Give their food on time and take them regularly for walks this is all you need to do to make your dog your best friend.
